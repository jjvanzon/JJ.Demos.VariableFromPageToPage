JJ.Demos.VariableFromPageToPage
=======================

*Jan-Joost van Zon, 2010-07*

Some experiments with getting a variable from one page to the next with purely HTML and JavaScript.
It is mostly in Dutch.
Open 'Hoofdpagina_SetCookie.html' with Firefox. The value you enter will be retrieved in the next page when you press the button.
Don't try opening it in Chrome or Opera. Those do not seem to want to work with cookies if you just open an HTML file.
