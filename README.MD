JJ.Demos.VariableFromPageToPage
=======================

*Jan-Joost van Zon, 2010-07*

Some experiments with getting a variable from one page to the next with purely HTML and JavaScript. The final solution in does not seem to work anymore. Hmmm... I suspect a problem where the date formatting of the cookie expiry date is non-standard. I might fix that later.

Also, a lot of it is Dutch, not English.
